This is a web application that allow the user to create notes and post quotes. The notes are just like post-it cork board.

### React, React Router
This application was created with [ReactJS](https://react.dev/). ReactRouter dependency was used to manage routing and Firebase dependency for the backend user authentication.

### Highlights
To use the corkboard the user must create an account and logged in.

Post-it notes use database. The Data is fetched with a custom hook either to GET, POST, PUT or DELETE an item.

Notes can be created, read, updated and deleted (CRUD) with a intuitive and visual experience.

The CSS style of the website was entirely coded by hand using CSS module. Just like JSX, no external code was copied.

The application is completely responsive.
